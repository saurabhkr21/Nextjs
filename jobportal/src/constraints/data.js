You don't just write software—you build AI-driven systems that make traditional engineering look sluggish and inefficient. If that sounds like you, keep reading.\n\nMost software teams are still writing code the old way—manual debugging, trial-and-error deployments, and features that barely leverage AI beyond a sprinkle of Copilot suggestions. Trilogy is different. Every part of our development process is infused with AI: feature ideation, bug detection, defect resolution, and performance optimization. This isn't about dabbling in AI tools; this is about fully integrating AI into the software lifecycle to eliminate waste, ship faster, and build with precision.\n\nIn this role, you will take existing B2B products, break them down, rebuild them as cloud-native applications, and optimize them with AI at every level. You'll be developing and deploying AI-powered features, using cutting-edge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect detection, and ensuring every release is smooth—zero outages, zero disruptions, zero excuses. If you're looking for a job where you spend weeks debating architecture decisions instead of shipping, this isn't it.\n\nIf you're ready to push the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering and accelerate your career into high-scale cloud-native development, apply now. If you prefer sticking to what you already know, writing test cases by hand, or working in teams that are afraid of automation, this isn't for you.\n\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n• Using analysis tools and RAG vector stores to identify, diagnose, and correct product defects and fix bugs.\n• Leveraging AI development agents to design, develop, and deploy innovative features for cloud-native applications.\n• Collaborating with a global team to deliver high-quality, enterprise-grade solutions.\n\nWhat You Won’t Be Doing\n• Routine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.\n• Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms. Expect more coding, less talking.\n\nBack End Developer Key Responsibilities\n• Implement AI-driven features to streamline workflows and empower service providers with innovative tools.\n\nBasic Requirements\n• 4+ years of professional experience in commercial software development, focusing on production code for server-side web applications\n• Experience using GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0.dev); we are not looking for traditional ML engineers without LLM experience\n• A willingness to use GenAI in your day-to-day development work\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform.
